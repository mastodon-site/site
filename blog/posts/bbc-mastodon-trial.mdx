As the UK's national broadcaster, the BBC has a set objective of making its content available both to UK citizens and around the world. They've been an early adopter of social media, online streaming, podcasting and many other technologies that can help them be widely reachable.

Now, the research and development team within the BBC have started a six month trial of Mastodon since it's fast gaining adoption - mostly as a result of the changes at Twitter (now known as X.com) since it was taken over by Elon Musk late last year.

This is a major move by a world-renowned media outlet. It's a small step - mostly focussed on two of their radio stations - but still a great indication that they see this as being a growing social network and a viable way to reach people.

The BBC's News Twitter accounts, especially its `@BBCBreaking` account with over 50 million followers, have historically been one of the first ways in which many people have gotten access to news as it happens. If they replicate the content they already make to other social networks that could be a huge win for the group of open source projects like Mastodon, known commonly as the Fediverse.

## Brands no longer want to be associated with Twitter

Since the end of 2022, a huge number of advertisers and users have started to leave Twitter, as a result of changes and decisions being taken by its new management. Along with a growing amount of far-right content and cryptocurrency scam bots, the changes to verification that meant brands and organisations like the BBC lost, and then regained at a much higher cost, access to a verification process to prove their identity.

One of the main benefits of decentralised social media like Mastodon, is that companies, brands, or even individuals, can use their own domain names to host their online presence. The BBC, for example, have chosen to host their Mastodon service on https://social.bbc - this is a great way of proving that their posts are genuine, and can be trusted in the same way as other BBC content.
