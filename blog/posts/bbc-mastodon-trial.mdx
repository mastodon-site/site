As the UK's national broadcaster, the BBC has a set objective of making its content available both to UK citizens and around the world. They've been an early adopter of social media, online streaming, podcasting and many other technologies that can help them be widely reachable.

Now, the research and development team within the BBC have started a six month trial of Mastodon since it's fast gaining adoption - mostly as a result of the changes at X.com (formerly Twitter.com) since it was taken over by Elon Musk late last year.

This is a major move by a world-renowned media outlet. It's a small step - mostly focussed on two of their radio stations - but still a great indication that they see this as being a growing social network and a viable way to reach people.

The BBC's news Twitter accounts have historically been one of the first ways in which many people have gotten access to breaking news; if they replicate the content they already make to other social networks that could be a huge win for the group of open source projects like Mastodon, known commonly as the Fediverse.
