As the UK's national broadcaster, the BBC has a set objective of making its content widely available to UK citizens and more broadly. They've been an early adopter of social media, online streaming, podcasting and many other technologies that can help them to be reachable.

Now, the research and development team within the BBC have started a six month trial of Mastodon since it's fast gaining adoption - mostly as a result of the changes at X (formerly Twitter) since it was taken over by Elon Musk late last year.
