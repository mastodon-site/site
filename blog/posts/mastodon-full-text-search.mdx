The upcoming version of Mastodon server, 4.2, is currently in beta but is now close to complete in terms of work and features to be added.

One of the most highly anticipated additions is full text search. We'll try and cover what it means, and what it adds to Mastodon.

## The state of search today

Currently, most Mastodon servers are running the latest version, 4.1 - including all [Mastodon servers managed by mastodon.site](/mastodon-instances). By default the simple text search allows you to find display names, user names and hashtags. You cannot search the text of posts themselves.

## Search in Mastodon 4.2

Once a server upgrades, the setting will be available to users but on an opt-in basis.
