[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) is a fast-growing social media network, but it's radically different from how big tech companies like Twitter and Facebook work.

We've put together this guide as a 101 class based on questions new users have in their first few days of exploring the fediverse.

## Okay - where is everybody?

First thing you'll notice after signing up, when you join you'll an empty timeline. It's pretty quiet!

Unlike platforms like Twitter or Threads, which start you off by suggesting accounts or posts with large numbers of followers or likes, Mastodon is much more hands-off.

You'll have an empty news feed by default and the freedom to build your own timeline catering to your interests - there are no alogrithms or recommendation engines here. This can be seen as good or bad, and while it does make the process a little slower in the start, as you build your feed it will remain free from adverts or suggested posts that you would still see on other larger platforms.

A good place to start exploring are the `Explore`, `Local`, and `Federated` tabs.

## Local? Federated?  What??

Big tech social media depends on one centralised platform that all users share - for exmaple, when you use Twitter, everyone on there is using the same service and has a username that's just `@name`.

When people talk about Mastodon being decentralised, they mean that it's not one big system but thousands of independent servers joining together. Think of it a bit more like email; you can be using `john@gmail.com` and your friend is `sarah@outlook.com`, but you can contact each other despite using different services because the protocol (email, in this case) is the same.
