[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) is a fast-growing social media network, but it's radically different from how big tech companies like Twitter and Facebook work.

We've put together this guide as a 101 class based on questions new users have in their first few days of exploring the fediverse.

## Okay - where is everybody?

First thing you'll notice after signing up, when you join you'll an empty timeline. It's pretty quiet!

Unlike platforms like Twitter or Threads, which start you off by suggesting accounts or posts with large numbers of followers or likes, Mastodon is much more hands-off.

You'll have an empty news feed by default and the freedom to build your own timeline catering to your interests - there are no alogrithms or recommendation engines here. This can be seen as good or bad, and while it does make the process a little slower in the start, as you build your feed it will remain free from adverts or suggested posts that you would still see on other larger platforms.

A good place to start exploring are the `Explore`, `Local`, and `Federated` tabs.

## Local? Federated?  What??
