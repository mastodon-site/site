This page will show you how to configure your domain name on Cloudflare to work with Mastodon.site.

<Tip>The steps are the same whether you're using a domain name root or a subdomain; we'll show both for clarity.</Tip>

## Add DNS records

We use two DNS records for Mastodon.site servers; one to point to the actual server, and the other for the media assets - photos, videos, etc - that users upload to their account. You'll need to add both to your domain name in Cloudflare.

1. From the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com), choose the domain for your mastodon server
2. From the menu on the left, go to `DNS` -> `Records`
3. Click the `Add record` button; you'll need to add the following **two** records

### Domain root

If you're using a domain root (for example, `https://mastodon.site`)

| Type   | Name (required)  | Target (required)    | Proxy status           | TTL   |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------|
| CNAME  | @                | cname.mastodon.site  | Flip to off (DNS only) | Auto  |
| CNAME  | mastodon-assets  | cname.mastodon.site  | Flip to off (DNS only) | Auto  |


### Subdomain

If you're using a subdomain (for example, `https://social.mastodon.site`) - replace the word `social` in the **name** of each record with the subdomain you're using

| Type   | Name (required)         | Target (required)    | Proxy status           | TTL   |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-------|
| CNAME  | social                  | cname.mastodon.site  | Flip to off (DNS only) | Auto  |
| CNAME  | mastodon-assets.social  | cname.mastodon.site  | Flip to off (DNS only) | Auto  |

## Testing the DNS records

Once they're both set, it can take a short while for them to be available across the internet. You can use [WhatsMyDNS.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net) to test that it's working - you'll see a green tick next to a list of IP addresses once it's ready.
