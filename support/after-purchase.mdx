Thanks for signing up for mastodon.site - we got your payment, and we'll be in touch shortly on the email address you provided in Stripe.

If you need to change anything with your payment, or the email address for us to reach you on, use the [Stripe portal](https://billing.stripe.com/p/login/dR64ij3KJbrLdZm000).

## Next steps

We'll ask you for some info on the instance you want set up:

- the domain name on which to set up the instance
- the name of the first (admin) user
- the email address for that first admin user

That's usually all we need to get you started!
