At Mastodon.site, we don't register or manage domain names for you. If you decide to [bring your own domain name](/managed-server/domain-name), you'll need to update a few settings to get your mastodon server up and running.

When you buy a domain name, you use a company called a `registrar` - they manage the payments and annual renewals. In most cases, the registrar will also set you up with their `nameservers` ; nameservers link your domain name to specific servers on the internet.

<Tip>You'll need to update those nameservers in order to use Mastodon.site with a domain name.</Tip>
