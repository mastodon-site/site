When a Mastodon server is running, it stores different types of data in a number of places.

- The database (PostgreSQL) will store the users and posts of the server, as well as information about other servers, their users and posts too
- The media storage (often [S3-compatible object storage](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/optional/object-storage/)) stores user-uploaded images, videos, user profile photos and profile header images
- The server stores the state of background tasks in queues (Redis)

You can see the storage used by each in the server's admin panel.

The database is the most important of the data, as well as some of the media storage, though it includes some cache data that can be recreated.

Redis data is important to keep, as losing the queue data might drop some posts or federation of data that hasn't yet completed.
