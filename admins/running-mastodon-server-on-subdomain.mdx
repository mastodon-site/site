Many Mastodon servers are running as compontent of a user, organisation or business's online presence. It's common that the server might share the domain name with a blog, an online store, a forum, etc. This page is intended to offer tips on running multiple services - including a Mastodon server - on a single domain.

## Decide if Mastodon is the primary service

DNS offers a lot of flexibility in terms of how you run multiple services on [one domain name](/managed-server/domain-name).

Depending on your domain's nameserver, you should be able to choose between your Mastodon instance being on the domain root (eg: `https://mastodon.site`) or a subdomain, like `https://social.mastodon.site`. Which you choose probably depends on what your primary focus is with your domain name; if you're a business, store, or blog, the root service is likely to be something other than Mastodon. If Mastodon is the primary service, that is a simple setup for Mastodon and not covered by this guide.

## Simple subdomain setup

The easiest option here is to run Mastodon as a subdomain.
