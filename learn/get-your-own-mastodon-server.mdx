When most people start using mastodon, they'll join one of the larger public servers like `mastodon.social`. Over time, though, you may want to start a server for yourself or move to a more specialised server. Here we talk through the best way to move your account.

## Mastodon's migration process

Mastodon does have a built-in process to migrate between servers, which does a lot of the work but has some limitations. Here's a rough overview of what it does currently:

* automatically moves your followers (you don't need to tell them you're changing server)
* sets a redirection message on your old server profile pointing to the new one
* let's you copy the list of people that you follow
* preserves your bookmarks, mute and block lists
