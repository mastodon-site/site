When most people start using mastodon, they'll join one of the larger public servers like `mastodon.social`. Over time, though, you may want to start a server for yourself or move to a more specialised server. Here we talk through the best way to move your account.

## Mastodon's migration process

Mastodon does have a built-in process to migrate between servers, which does a lot of the work but has some limitations. Here's a rough overview of what it does currently:

* automatically moves your followers (you don't need to tell them you're changing server, and they don't need to take any actions)
* sets a redirection message on your old server profile pointing to the new one
* lets you copy the list of people that you follow
* preserves your bookmarks, mute and block lists

<Info>Moving servers does **not** move your existing posts - they'll stay on the original server.</Info>

## Create the new account

The first step is to create the new account on your chosen server. If you're stuck finding a new home, [fedi.garden](https://fedi.garden) and [joinmastodon.org/servers](https://joinmastodon.org/servers) are great resources; we can also [create and manage a mastodon server for you](https://mastodon.site/mastodon-servers)!

You'll need to use the `Preferences` page on the server you're moving to, so make sure you're using it from the web instead of an app.

1. Once in the `Preferences` page, click on the `Account` tab, and scroll to `Moving from a different account`
2. Enter the username of your existing account to transfer and click `Create alias`

##Â Export from the old account

While your new server sets up the alias, go to the `Preferences` page on your old server and use it to export some other data.
