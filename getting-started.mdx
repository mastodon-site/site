## First things first

1. Decide on your [server domain name](#deciding-on-your-domain-name)
2. Decide on your [server pricing plan](#deciding-on-your-server-pricing-plan)
3. [Subscribe today](#start-your-subscription) and let's get going!

## Deciding on your domain name

All mastodon.site subscriptions include a free subdomain on our domain name, or the option to [bring your own domain name](/managed-server/domain-name) at no extra charge.

We'll ask you what you'd prefer to do once you start the subscription. We've also got [guides on configuring an existing domain name](https://mastodon.site/support/help-mastodon-dns-domain-names) if that's your choice.

## Deciding on your server pricing plan

We offer a few flexible subscription prices for different sized servers, including a plan for single-user servers.

It's fine to start small - this can always be changed later if your server needs grow, or if you feel like you want to downgrade.

<Info>If you're moving from a shared server to a single-user server, check out our [account migration guide](/learn/get-your-own-mastodon-server).</Info>

## Start your subscription

Start the subscription by selecting the plan you'd like on the [server pricing page](/mastodon-servers) - all payments are secured by Stripe and you can manage your payment details with them at any time.

You'll be asked for an email address during payment; we'll contact you on that email address once the payment is confirmed to ask about your domain name choices.

<Tip>You can [reach out to us](/support/overview) at any point if you have questions - and if for any reason, you change your mind after subscribing, we can fix that for you too.</Tip>
