## first things first

1. Decide on your server domain name
2. Decide on your server pricing plan
3. Subscribe today and let's get going!

## Deciding on your domain name

All mastodon.site subscriptions include a free subdomain on our domain name, or the optional to [bring your own domain name](/managed-server/domain-name) at no extra charge.

We'll ask you what you'd prefer to do once you start the subscription. We've also got [guides on configuring an existing domain name](https://mastodon.site/support/help-mastodon-dns-domain-names) if that's what you'd like to do.

## Deciding on your server pricing plan

We offer a few flexible subscription prices for different sized servers, including a plan for single-user servers.

This can always be changed later if your server needs grow, or if you feel like you want to downgrade.

<Tip>If your moving from a shared server to a single-user server, check out our [account migration guide](/learn/get-your-own-mastodon-server).</Tip>
