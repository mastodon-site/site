At Mastodon.site, we take the hard work out of running a Mastodon server, so you can just enjoy posting content to the growing fediverse of people.

Any questions? [feel free to reach out to us](/support/overview) - we can help! And don't worry, you can always upgrade a server if you just want to start out small.

Our prices are in Euro (â‚¬) but our payment provider, Stripe, accepts all major currencies, debit and credit cards, and supports Apple Pay and Google Pay.
