At Mastodon.site, we take the hard work out of running a Mastodon server, so you can just enjoy posting content to the growing fediverse of people.

Our prices are in Euro (â‚¬) but our payment provider, Stripe, accepts all major currencies, debit and credit cards, and supports Apple Pay and Google Pay.

Any questions? [feel free to reach out to us](/support/overview) - we can help!

You can always start small and upgrade to a larger server over time if you need to. We can help you decide when the time is right.
