At **mastodon.site**, we take the hard work out of running a Mastodon server so that you can just focus on posting content your audience enjoys!

ðŸ›Ÿ Any questions? [feel free to reach out to us](/support/overview) - we can help! And don't worry, you can always upgrade a server later if you just want to start out small.
