<Tip>Signing up for [social.mastodon.site](https://social.mastodon.site) is free for everyone! This page covers the costs if you'd like us to [manage a mastodon instance for you](/mastodon-instances).</Tip>

To keep our pricing fair, we try to charge based on your usage. We have a range of different instance types to suit most people.

You can find the current price of our instances on the mastodon [instance packages page](/mastodon-instances).

There are a few costs we add up to create our pricing:

* **Space usage** - the database and media storage costs associated with your instance (you can [see these any time in the admin dashboard](/admins/understanding-space-usage))
* **Servers** - larger, busier instances require more computing power
* **Media egress** - the cost of your instance sending data out to the internet (when people view attached photos, for example)

## Fair usage

In most cases these numbers will be covered within the package that you choose. However, if you often go above what we expect for a instance of that size, we can help you work out why, move you to a larger instance, or add additional usage based costs to your current instance.
